# Details
  
#### How was the project initiated?

Leo Toyama wanted the new RAs within Data Insights to be trained in the various technical tools that we use as a team. Anthony and Veni had previously run a Git workshop for the data science team and Anthony was asked to adapt this for complete beginners.

#### What was the goal of the project

To help new users of Git to understand how GitHub Desktop works.

The rest of this README is a template of other sections you could include yourself.

#### Outputs

- There is a notebook of code and analysis [here](http://tinytuba.com/). _(Likely Github)_
- There is a flex dashboard available for investigation [here](http://tinytuba.com/). _(Likely Dropbox)_
- There is a presentation of key results here [here](http://corndog.io/). _(Likely Dropbox)_

#### Insights

For more detailed information see the documents above. 

We found the following high-level insights:

- Comedy, Drama, Children's and Music are not as affected by the weekend as other genres. 
- Viewers do not listen to sport related content when weekend sports are on linear TV.
- There is a peak of childrens content consumption around 7pm on a Sunday suggesting a 'book hour' or 'bedtime hour'. 
- Comedy & Drama exhibit a Sunday eve skew with higher consumption.
- For News, peak consumption occurs on a Saturday morning.
- Sport exhibits two peaks on both days at the weekend. 


#### Recommendations (if any)

- Consider a 'book hour' or 'bedtime hour' at 7pm on a Sunday and possibly in the week to address those consuming childerens content at this time. 

#### Key challenges (if any)

- Potential issue with an odd peak in the data at midnight. This was left out for safety. 
- Sample sizes are currently limited.
- Stakeholders struggling to make time to read through detailed notebook. 

#### Changes made by Stakeholder(s) (if any)

- Sounds are now curating their weekend content by:
  1. Providing specific reading hour content on Sundays
  2.  Changing the 'Hot Podcasts' rail to have a higher proportion of comedy and drama on a Sunday evening.  

#### Quotes from stakeholder (for new projects)

- "The work by person X has informed our content placement and enabled us to focus the provision of content on weekend evenings. It has also enabled us to ask other questions and we are now looking to prototype user recommendations on the podcast rail in the app".

# Impact & Additional Work

#### Impact of change

- MVT on the 'Hot Podcasts' rail has suggested that the inclusion of a children's reading hour increases average Sunday use by 7 minutes. 
- Our colleague in Sounds editorial - Person Y - now saves 5 hours a week because they don't have to identify content from all genres (only Childrens, Comedy and Drama)

#### Further work

This stimulated further work around the creation of a personalised recommendation engine designed to re-order the contents of the 'Hot Podcasts' rail. Early protoypes have been completed and we are currently considering how this might be deployed / scaled. 

#### Could this be applied to other products?

Yes - the analysis could easily apply to iPlayer data. The recommendation engine was developed using data from both Sounds and Iplayer and could be expanded to apply to content beyond it's current focus. I would suggest that we look into expanding it to Homepage and the iPlayer recommendations rail.

#### Actioning needed (if any) 

N/A.
